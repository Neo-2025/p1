# Authentication Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Summary
The login page initially had a non-functional login button with no feedback or redirect after entering credentials. The issue was related to user authentication with Supabase.

## Current State of Authentication

### Authentication Flow
1. The login page (`/auth/login`) presents a form with email and password fields
2. Form submission attempts to authenticate using Supabase client
3. On successful authentication, a session is created and user is redirected to dashboard
4. Middleware protects routes based on authentication state

### Authentication Components
- **LoginForm.tsx**: Client-side form handling authentication
- **middleware.ts**: Protects dashboard and subscription routes
- **seed-db.js**: Creates/updates the default user

### Supabase Integration
- Authentication is connected to Supabase Auth service
- User data is stored in Supabase Auth tables
- Environmental variables control the connection to Supabase

## Identified Issues and Fixes

### 1. User Credentials Issue
**Problem**: The test user existed in Supabase but login failed with incorrect credentials
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced seed script to check for existing user and update credentials
- Added verification step to confirm login works after user creation/update

### 2. Debugging Enhancements
**Problem**: No feedback on login issues made debugging difficult
**Solution**:
- Added client-side debug information display
- Created login-related console logs
- Added server-side test API route to verify authentication status

### 3. Environment Variable Issues
**Problem**: Environment variables weren't being properly accessed
**Solution**:
- Explicitly configured dotenv to load .env.local
- Added environment variable validation to scripts

## How to Verify Authentication Works

1. **Test API Endpoint**:
   Access `/api/auth/test` to verify Supabase connection and auth configuration

2. **Run Seed Script**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/seed-db.js
   ```
   This ensures the test user exists with correct credentials

3. **Login Credentials**:
   - Email: bracketmaster@proton.me
   - Password: Episode1!

## Future Enhancements

1. **Better Error Messages**: Display more specific error messages on login failure
2. **Password Reset Flow**: Implement a password reset process
3. **MFA Support**: Add multi-factor authentication when needed
4. **OAuth Providers**: Support third-party login (Google, GitHub, etc.)

## Testing Notes

When testing the authentication flow, monitor:
1. Browser console for client-side logs
2. Network requests to Supabase endpoints
3. Server logs for authentication errors
4. Debug info displayed on the login form

The current implementation focuses on a single hard-coded user for simplicity while preserving the infrastructure for multi-user authentication in the future.
