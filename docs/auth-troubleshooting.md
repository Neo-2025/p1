# Authentication Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Summary
The login page initially had a non-functional login button with no feedback or redirect after entering credentials. The issue was related to user authentication with Supabase.

## Current State of Authentication

### Authentication Flow
1. The login page (`/auth/login`) presents a form with two authentication options:
   - Password-based authentication
   - Magic link (passwordless) authentication
2. Form submission authenticates using Supabase client
3. On successful authentication, a session is created and user is redirected to dashboard
4. For magic links, an email is sent and the user completes authentication by clicking the link
5. Middleware protects routes based on authentication state

### Authentication Components
- **LoginForm.tsx**: Client-side form handling authentication (password & magic link)
- **middleware.ts**: Protects dashboard and subscription routes
- **seed-db.js**: Creates/updates the default user
- **callback/route.ts**: Handles magic link callbacks and session creation

### Supabase Integration
- Authentication is connected to Supabase Auth service
- User data is stored in Supabase Auth tables
- Environmental variables control the connection to Supabase
- OTP (One-Time Password) support for magic links

## Identified Issues and Fixes

### 1. User Credentials Issue
**Problem**: The test user existed in Supabase but login failed with incorrect credentials
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced seed script to check for existing user and update credentials
- Added verification step to confirm login works after user creation/update

### 2. Debugging Enhancements
**Problem**: No feedback on login issues made debugging difficult
**Solution**:
- Added client-side debug information display
- Created login-related console logs
- Added server-side test API route to verify authentication status

### 3. Environment Variable Issues
**Problem**: Environment variables weren't being properly accessed
**Solution**:
- Explicitly configured dotenv to load .env.local
- Added environment variable validation to scripts

### 4. Magic Link Authentication
**Addition**: Implemented passwordless authentication via magic links
- Added toggle between password and magic link authentication
- Created callback route handler for processing magic links
- Added success messages for magic link emails
- Set up error handling for the magic link flow

## How to Verify Authentication Works

1. **Password Authentication**:
   - Email: bracketmaster@proton.me
   - Password: Episode1!

2. **Magic Link Authentication**:
   - Enter email: bracketmaster@proton.me
   - Click "Send Magic Link"
   - Check email for magic link
   - Click link to complete authentication
   - User is redirected to dashboard

3. **Test API Endpoint**:
   Access `/api/auth/test` to verify Supabase connection and auth configuration

4. **Run Seed Script**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/seed-db.js
   ```
   This ensures the test user exists with correct credentials

## Future Enhancements

1. **Better Error Messages**: Display more specific error messages on login failure
2. **Password Reset Flow**: Implement a password reset process
3. **MFA Support**: Add multi-factor authentication when needed
4. **OAuth Providers**: Support third-party login (Google, GitHub, etc.)
5. **Email Templates**: Customize magic link email templates

## Testing Notes

When testing the authentication flow, monitor:
1. Browser console for client-side logs
2. Network requests to Supabase endpoints
3. Server logs for authentication errors
4. Debug info displayed on the login form
5. Email delivery for magic links

The current implementation supports both password-based authentication and magic links while preserving the infrastructure for future multi-user authentication.
