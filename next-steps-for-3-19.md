## Branch Management Best Practices

### Feature Branch Workflow
1. Create focused feature branches
2. Use semantic commit messages
3. Create PRs for review
4. Merge to main only after:
   - Code review completed
   - Tests passing
   - Preview environment verified
   - Documentation updated

### Branch Naming Convention
- Feature branches: `feat/description`
- Bug fixes: `fix/description`
- Documentation: `docs/description`
- Refactoring: `refactor/description`

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Code style changes
- refactor: Code refactoring
- test: Adding tests
- chore: Maintenance tasks

## Next Actions
1. [ ] Push current changes to `feat/drizzle-setup`
2. [ ] Create and switch to `feat/s4-integration`
3. [ ] Begin directory structure setup
4. [ ] Set up story documentation system

## Notes
- Keep branches focused and small
- Document all major decisions
- Update this document as tasks are completed
- Regular commits with clear messages
- Test in preview environments before merging
