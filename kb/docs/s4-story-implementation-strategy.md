# S4 Story Implementation Strategy Guide

## Overview
This guide provides practical implementation steps for the hybrid approach of maintaining full MVP context while implementing stories sequentially, with emphasis on thread management and context maintenance.

## Initial Review Process

### 1. Full Suite Review Prompt
```yaml
# Initial Review Prompt
prompt: |
  You are reviewing a minimally viable MVP story suite for S4 compliance and implementation planning.
  
  Story Suite:
  {full_story_suite}
  
  Please analyze:
  1. S4 Compliance
     - Story completeness
     - Technical clarity
     - Dependencies
     - Implementation order
  
  2. MVP Scope Assessment
     - Core features
     - Technical boundaries
     - Data models
     - Component hierarchy
  
  3. Implementation Strategy
     - Story sequencing
     - Technical patterns
     - Reusable components
     - Testing approach
  
  Output a "New Thread Primer on MVP Scope" including:
  1. MVP Overview
     - Core value proposition
     - Key features
     - Technical boundaries
  
  2. Story Suite Analysis
     - Implementation order
     - Dependencies
     - Technical patterns
     - Reusable components
  
  3. Technical Architecture
     - Data models
     - Component hierarchy
     - API structure
     - Testing strategy
  
  4. Implementation Guidelines
     - Pattern standards
     - Code organization
     - Testing requirements
     - Documentation needs
```

### 2. Thread Management
```yaml
# Thread Context Management
thread_context:
  new_thread:
    - "Review MVP Scope Primer"
    - "Update with recent A_D"
    - "Set current story context"
    - "Establish thread goals"
  
  daily_routine:
    - "Review MVP Scope Primer"
    - "Update A_D decisions"
    - "Validate story progress"
    - "Adjust implementation"
```

## Implementation Workflow

### 1. Initial Setup
```yaml
# Setup Steps
setup:
  phase_1: "MVP Review"
    steps:
      - "Run Full Suite Review"
      - "Generate MVP Scope Primer"
      - "Validate S4 compliance"
      - "Establish patterns"
  
  phase_2: "Thread Preparation"
    steps:
      - "Review MVP Scope"
      - "Update with A_D"
      - "Set story context"
      - "Begin implementation"
```

### 2. Daily Routine
```yaml
# Daily Process
routine:
  morning:
    - "Review MVP Scope Primer"
    - "Update with new A_D"
    - "Set day's objectives"
  
  implementation:
    - "Reference MVP context"
    - "Follow established patterns"
    - "Document decisions"
  
  evening:
    - "Update MVP Scope"
    - "Document A_D"
    - "Plan next steps"
```

### 3. Thread Management
```yaml
# Thread Guidelines
thread_management:
  new_thread:
    prompt: |
      Starting new thread for {story_id}
      
      Current MVP Context:
      {mvp_scope_primer}
      
      Recent A_D:
      {architectural_decisions}
      
      Story Context:
      {story_details}
      
      Implementation Goals:
      {thread_objectives}
  
  context_maintenance:
    - "Regular MVP Scope reviews"
    - "A_D documentation"
    - "Pattern consistency"
    - "Dependency tracking"
```

## Success Metrics

### 1. Context Quality
```yaml
# Context Metrics
metrics:
  mvp_scope:
    - "Completeness"
    - "Clarity"
    - "Up-to-date status"
  implementation:
    - "Pattern adherence"
    - "Dependency management"
    - "Technical consistency"
```

### 2. Thread Efficiency
```yaml
# Thread Metrics
metrics:
  context_management:
    - "Scope review frequency"
    - "A_D documentation"
    - "Pattern consistency"
  implementation:
    - "Story completion"
    - "Code quality"
    - "Technical debt"
```

## Implementation Checklist

### 1. Initial Setup
- [ ] Run Full Suite Review
- [ ] Generate MVP Scope Primer
- [ ] Validate S4 compliance
- [ ] Establish patterns

### 2. Thread Management
- [ ] Review MVP Scope daily
- [ ] Update A_D decisions
- [ ] Maintain context
- [ ] Track dependencies

### 3. Implementation
