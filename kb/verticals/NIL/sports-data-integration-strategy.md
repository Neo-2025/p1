# Sports Data Integration Strategy for NIL Vault

## 1. NCAA Data Integration Layer

### Core API Architecture
```typescript
interface NCAADataBridge {
  sources: {
    primary: {
      name: "UniSport NCAA Aggregator",
      updateFrequency: "Real-time",
      webhookSupport: true,
      sports: ["football", "basketball", "baseball", "soccer"]
    },
    backup: {
      name: "RapidAPI NCAA Collection",
      updateFrequency: "15min",
      webhookSupport: false,
      sports: ["all NCAA sports"]
    }
  },
  dataTypes: {
    athlete: {
      profile: "Bio and eligibility data",
      performance: "Game and season stats",
      rankings: "Position and overall rankings",
      media: "Highlights and photos"
    },
    team: {
      schedule: "Game calendar",
      results: "Scores and outcomes",
      rankings: "Team performance metrics",
      roster: "Current team composition"
    }
  }
}
```

### Webhook Implementation
```typescript
interface WebhookSystem {
  triggers: {
    gameCompletion: {
      data: "Final score and stats",
      delay: "< 5 minutes",
      validation: "Multi-source confirmation"
    },
    statsUpdate: {
      data: "Performance metrics",
      delay: "Real-time",
      validation: "Official NCAA feed"
    },
    rankingChange: {
      data: "New ranking position",
      delay: "< 1 hour",
      validation: "Cross-reference multiple polls"
    }
  },
  delivery: {
    methods: ["HTTP POST", "WebSocket", "Event Stream"],
    formats: ["JSON", "Protocol Buffers"],
    retry: {
      attempts: 3,
      backoff: "Exponential"
    }
  }
}
```

## 2. High School Data Collection

### RankScraper Engine
```typescript
interface RankScraperConfig {
  sources: {
    national: {
      maxPreps: {
        url: "maxpreps.com/rankings",
        frequency: "Daily",
        sports: ["All"],
        regions: ["National", "State"]
      },
      on3: {
        url: "on3.com/rankings",
        frequency: "Weekly",
        sports: ["Football"],
        regions: ["National"]
      },
      hsfa: {
        url: "highschoolfootballamerica.com",
        frequency: "Weekly",
        sports: ["Football"],
        regions: ["National", "Regional"]
      }
    },
    state: {
      texas: {
        url: "uiltexas.org/athletics",
        frequency: "Daily",
        sports: ["All UIL sports"],
        regions: ["Districts", "Conferences"]
      },
      florida: {
        url: "fhsaa.com/sports",
        frequency: "Daily",
        sports: ["All FHSAA sports"],
        regions: ["Districts", "Classifications"]
      }
    }
  },
  scraping: {
    method: "Headless Chrome",
    rateLimit: "Respectful crawling",
    caching: "24-hour retention",
    validation: "Multi-source verification"
  }
}
```

### AthleteReport Self-Reporting System
```typescript
interface SelfReportingSystem {
  dataCollection: {
    performance: {
      gameStats: {
        required: ["Date", "Opponent", "Score", "Position"],
        optional: ["Advanced metrics", "Coach notes"]
      },
      training: {
        required: ["Date", "Type", "Duration"],
        optional: ["Performance metrics", "Video clips"]
      },
      achievements: {
        academic: ["GPA", "Honors", "Awards"],
        athletic: ["Records", "Milestones", "Recognition"]
      }
    },
    verification: {
      methods: {
        primary: "Coach verification portal",
        secondary: ["Team admin", "Athletic director"],
        media: ["Game footage", "Official stats", "Local news"]
      },
      workflow: {
        submission: "Athlete inputs data",
        review: "Coach receives notification",
        approval: "Multi-step verification",
        publication: "Data added to athlete profile"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Data Unification Layer

### Entity Resolution
```typescript
interface EntityResolution {
  identifiers: {
    primary: "NIL Vault Athlete ID",
    secondary: ["NCAA ID", "NFHS ID", "State IDs"],
    verification: ["School records", "Official rosters"]
  },
  matching: {
    rules: {
      exact: ["Name", "DOB", "School ID"],
      fuzzy: ["Name variations", "Previous schools"],
      composite: "Multi-factor confidence score"
    },
    resolution: {
      conflicts: "Manual review queue",
      updates: "Automated profile merging",
      history: "Change tracking log"
    }
  }
}
```

### Performance Standardization
```typescript
interface MetricsStandard {
  common: {
    temporal: ["Game", "Season", "Career"],
    statistical: ["Basic", "Advanced", "Composite"],
    contextual: ["Competition level", "Opposition quality"]
  },
  sportSpecific: {
    football: {
      offense: ["Yards", "Touchdowns", "Completion %"],
      defense: ["Tackles", "Interceptions", "Sacks"],
      special: ["Return yards", "Field goals", "Punting"]
    },
    basketball: {
      scoring: ["Points", "FG%", "3P%"],
      other: ["Rebounds", "Assists", "Blocks"],
      advanced: ["PER", "True shooting %", "Win shares"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. NFT Card Integration

### Dynamic Card Updates
```typescript
interface NFTCardSystem {
  templates: {
    rookie: "Basic stats and bio",
    varsity: "Enhanced with verified achievements",
    elite: "Full performance history and media"
  },
  updateTriggers: {
    performance: "Post-game stat verification",
    ranking: "Weekly ranking updates",
    achievement: "Milestone completion",
    media: "New highlight verification"
  },
  attributes: {
    core: ["Name", "Team", "Position", "Year"],
    stats: ["Season totals", "Career highlights"],
    media: ["Action photos", "Highlight clips"],
    special: ["Awards", "Records", "Rankings"]
  }
}
```

### Verification System
```typescript
interface VerificationProtocol {
  sources: {
    official: ["NCAA database", "State athletic associations"],
    trusted: ["Verified coaches", "School administrators"],
    community: ["Team statisticians", "Local media"]
  },
  process: {
    submission: {
      required: ["Source documentation", "Witness verification"],
      optional: ["Media evidence", "Third-party validation"]
    },
    validation: {
      automated: "Statistical anomaly detection",
      manual: "Expert review for outliers",
      consensus: "Multi-source confirmation"
    }
  }
}
```
